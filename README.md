An open-source macOS Epic Games Launcher (and normal game launcher) alternative coded in SwiftUI.

The reason for this project's existence is to create a UI frontend for [Legendary](https://github.com/derrod/legendary) and to play windows games using wine-crossover and d3dmetal (game porting toolkit).

Mythic has been designed to look as 'macOS' as possible, to ensure coherence with the rest of the macOS environment

yeah, this is the new repo. blame git for undoing all of my changes (screw you git rebase!!!)
that's also why there's such little commits on such an elaborate project, i got my changes back but lost the .git folder
(i amended initial instead of committing anyway)

everything so far has been made by @blackxfiied
