<h4><b>An open-source Epic Games Launcher alternative and normal game launcher for macOS written in Swift.</b></h4>

We started this project to create a GUI frontend for [Legendary](https://github.com/derrod/legendary) and to play Windows games using Apple's game porting toolkit. Our has been designed to look as native as possible, to ensure coherence with the rest of the macOS environment.

## Features
- [Windows Game Support](https://github.com/MythicApp/Engine)
- Epic Games Support
