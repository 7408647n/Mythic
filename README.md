An open-source macOS Epic Games Launcher (and normal game launcher) alternative coded in SwiftUI.

The reason for this project's existence is to create a UI frontend for [Legendary](https://github.com/derrod/legendary) and to play windows games using wine-crossover and d3dmetal (game porting toolkit).

Mythic has been designed to look as 'macOS' as possible, while still being one of the ballsiest game launchers available.
